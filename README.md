# Cloud SIEM Content Catalog
This repository serves as a single place to view Cloud SIEM content (Rules, Mappers, Parsers, and Normalization Schema) in both markdown form and CSVs. This catalog is automatically generated based on content included out of the box as it is released. Changes manually introduced to individual markdown files will be overwritten by said automation.

# How do I use it?
Use the table of contents below to navigate. If you use the directory structure above, it will be harder to navigate.

You can also use GitHub search to easily find markdown files containing key words.
