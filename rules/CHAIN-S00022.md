# [Rules](README.md): Azure DevOps - Agent Pool Created and Deleted within a Short Period

## Description
Context:
An attacker may create Azure DevOps Agent Pools for malicious activity that are separate from an organizationâ€™s pools.

Detection:
This detection monitors for the creation and deletion of Agent Pools within 5 days by the same user, with the intent of finding Agent Pools active for short durations.

Recommended Actions:
If an alert occurs, investigate the actions taken by the account to determine if this is normal operation of deleting pools or if this suspicious activity. 

Tuning Recommendations: 
If necessary, add a tuning expression for users who frequently create and delete agent pools within the time period specified.
If necessary, adjust the "within" time period to better represent what is considered a short time period in your organization. Note that 5 days is the maximum time period you can specify for a chain rules.

Credits: 
This rule is loosely based on the Azure Sentinel ADOAgentPoolCreatedDeleted.yaml detection.
