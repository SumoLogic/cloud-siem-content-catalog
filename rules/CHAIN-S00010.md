# [Rules](README.md): Service Installation Followed By Elevated CMD Prompt

## Description
This rule looks for the installation of an application by a non-Sytem user quickly followed by the execution of cmd.exe with System privileges on the same host. This indicates a privilege escalation attempt was likely successful and correlates directly to CVE-2021-41379. The rule is designed to work with standard Security and System event logging, but Sysmon process logging can substitute in place of event ID 4688.
