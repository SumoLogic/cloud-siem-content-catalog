# [Rules](README.md): Windows - Scheduled Task Creation

## Description
A scheduled task was created in Windows or Azure. It is common for system administrators and approved software to create scheduled tasks, but adversaries are known to use them for persistence within a Windows environment. This rule is disabled by default due to the volume of events it can produce. Users should filter/exclude allowed scheduled tasks according to their environment before enabling the rule. The scheduled task name is logged in the "commandLine" field.
