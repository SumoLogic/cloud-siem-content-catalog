# [Rules](README.md): chage command use on host

## Description
The chage command on Linux allows for the changing of user password expiry information. The chage command is restricted to the root user; however, non-root/unprivileged users may use the -l flag to determine when the userâ€™s password or account is due to expire.  It is recommended to investigate the system and account the command has been executed on, to assess the intent of this execution. Additionally, looking at the command line and parent process is helpful in identifying valid automated processes executing this command that would benefit from tuning out via Rule Tuning.
