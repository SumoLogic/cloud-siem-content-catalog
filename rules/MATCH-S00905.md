# [Rules](README.md): Okta - Programmatic Access to Users API Endpoint

## Description
This signal looks for programmatic (PowerShell, Golang, Python or Curl) access to the Okta “users” API endpoint. This endpoint provides functionality to perform various actions on Okta user accounts such as password resets and account unlocks. A full list of functionality for this endpoint can be found in the Okta documentation here: https://developer.okta.com/docs/reference/api/users/- The “Success” field will indicate whether this API request was successful or not and the “Description” field will contain the event that was generated by the API request. Both failed and successful requests should be investigated. Ensure that this request was performed for legitimate purposes such as developer workflows or other automation mechanisms. Consider adding a match list exclusion with authorized accounts who perform requests to this Okta API endpoint via programmatic methods if this signal is triggering false positives.
