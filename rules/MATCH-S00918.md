# [Rules](README.md): Suspicious cat of PAM common-password policy

## Description
The Pluggable Authentication Module (PAM) in Linux allows system administrators to choose how applications authenticate users. The common-password file defines behavior of password use in Linux subsystems. This detection looks for use of cat to display the contents of the common-password file, which should not be a common occurrence on systems. It is recommended to investigate the host upon which this detection occurs to understand the exposure of the password policies for the system.
