# [Rules](README.md): First Seen vssadmin command From User

## Description
Threat actors may use the vssadmin utility to create volume shadow copies on a Windows operating system and retrieve the Active Directory database (NTDS.dit) file in order to extract credential material. This activity should be treated as high priority if not performed by an authorized systems administrator as part of normal and planned systems maintenance. If this activity is performed as part of normal system maintenance, the rule can be tuned to exclude these groups of users.
