# [Rules](README.md): Base32 in DNS Query

## Description
By using base32, binary and text data can be encoded in a way that is fully compliant with DNS protocol specifications.  Since common standard base32 uses 2-7 and the letters a-z, entropy must be measured to distinguish from normal text.  The presence of long base32 encoding in a DNS query may indicate tunneling of information out of a network.  Some security vendors and internet providers also use this technique to operate cloud infrastructure or transport information through firewalled environments.
