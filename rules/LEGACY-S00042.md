# [Rules](README.md): HTTP Request to Domain in Non-Standard TLD

## Description
HTTP request to a domain that is not under an ICANN-standard TLD. These TLDs are provided by alternate DNS root servers such as OpenNIC. Their use on corporate networks is fundamentally suspicious and potentially a sign of abuse by threat actors.
