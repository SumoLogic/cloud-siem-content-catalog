# [Rules](README.md): Wget Passed to Script Execution Command

## Description
Passing a downloaded file to a script execution command such as sh will immediately run the script. This is indicative of either high-risk user behavior or malicious activity as script contents should always be reviewed prior to execution. This can be used to run scripts on a host where remote command execution is possible.
