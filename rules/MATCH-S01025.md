# [Rules](README.md): Threat Intel - Inbound Traffic from Threat Feed IP (Low Confidence)

## Description
This rule detects allowed inbound traffic from an IP address with a low confidence rating from a threat intelligence feed.
Note that this rule is disabled by default due to a high likelihood of excessive signal volume and risk assignment to entities triggering this rule as-is. Tuning to reduce signal volume and potential false positives is highly recommended before activating this rule.
